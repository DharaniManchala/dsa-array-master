"""ðŸ§  Intuition (Logic)
Since the array is already sorted, duplicates will be next to each other.

We can use the two-pointer technique:

One pointer i to track the last position of the unique value.

The second pointer j to iterate through the array.

If nums[j] != nums[i], it's a new unique number. Increment i and place it at nums[i].
